Product Strategy | Design Management |  Service Design | Business Innovation | Design Systems | SaaS and E-commerce UX,"I am a Digital Product Designer with demonstrated work experience in SaaS and E-commerce platform design and innovation. I firmly believe that long-term business goals can be achieved successfully by simplifying the user journey. Therefore, I have a strong passion for aligning user expectations with business objectives. I solve core product problems to accomplish profitable yet user-centric solutions. 

Realising my deep interest in strategic design intervention, I currently lead the efforts on an innovative pilot project initiative for Backbase Asia Hub, which builds on Backbase’s Engagement Banking Platform and aims to accommodate Asia-specific retail banking features. 

Working directly with clients and large project teams on scalable products has helped me develop my skills of design resolution with effective stakeholder communication and design leadership. As exemplified in my latest projects at Backbase, I employ service design to elevate banking experience, thus simplifying banking for 60 million+ active customers. 

My leadership initiatives stem from my experience at Backbase, with resolving a complex product with evolving project scope. Some of these include driving UX pattern identification, standardisation and documentation, introducing an iterative design process with checkpoints for incremental changes, and advocating for regular CAB interventions to streamline change management. These initiatives have helped improve design management on the project, thus saving several months of retrospective design improvements.

I began my journey as a UX designer with Eagleowl, Bengaluru. I led end-to-end UX and UI design efforts on Eagleowl's products. Working in cross-functional collaboration with business, engineering and marketing helped develop my skills of deriving business innovation from design intervention, as demonstrated by my work on Eagleowl Marketplace 1.0. I also established a robust feedback loop with Eagleowl's clients, which helped me improve service on Eagleowl products, thus helping Eagleowl expand to 4 Indian cities in 6 months.

With my acquired experience, I aspire to continue my journey in Product Strategy in close connection with direct business innovation.

I am a Digital Product Designer with demonstrated work experience in SaaS and E-commerce platform design and innovation. I firmly believe that long-term business goals can be achieved successfully by simplifying the user journey. Therefore, I have a strong passion for aligning user expectations with business objectives. I solve core product problems to accomplish profitable yet user-centric solutions. 

Realising my deep interest in strategic design intervention, I currently lead the efforts on an innovative pilot project initiative for Backbase Asia Hub, which builds on Backbase’s Engagement Banking Platform and aims to accommodate Asia-specific retail banking features. 

Working directly with clients and large project teams on scalable products has helped me develop my skills of design resolution with effective stakeholder communication and design leadership. As exemplified in my latest projects at Backbase, I employ service design to elevate banking experience, thus simplifying banking for 60 million+ active customers. 

My leadership initiatives stem from my experience at Backbase, with resolving a complex product with evolving project scope. Some of these include driving UX pattern identification, standardisation and documentation, introducing an iterative design process with checkpoints for incremental changes, and advocating for regular CAB interventions to streamline change management. These initiatives have helped improve design management on the project, thus saving several months of retrospective design improvements.

I began my journey as a UX designer with Eagleowl, Bengaluru. I led end-to-end UX and UI design efforts on Eagleowl's products. Working in cross-functional collaboration with business, engineering and marketing helped develop my skills of deriving business innovation from design intervention, as demonstrated by my work on Eagleowl Marketplace 1.0. I also established a robust feedback loop with Eagleowl's clients, which helped me improve service on Eagleowl products, thus helping Eagleowl expand to 4 Indian cities in 6 months.

Freelance Sr. SEO Specialist | 📞 06-13349342 | Strategisch & Operationeel | Online marketeer,"Hoi, ik ben Billal 🙋🏽

Ontdek in 10 punten wie ik ben, wat me drijft en wat mijn expertise- en interesses zijn in online marketing:

1️⃣ Als een ervaren online marketeer heb ik een sterke focus op propositie en strategie, naast SEO, customer journey en CRO. Het ontwikkelen van een (SEO/CRO) strategie, optimaliseren van de customer journey en het stimuleren van conversies zijn mijn passie en ambitie. 🎯

2️⃣ De menselijke psychologie speelt een grote rol in mijn werk. Ik streef ernaar om uitdagingen en de ""vraag achter de vraag"" te achterhalen en te begrijpen. Ik gebruik intenties van de doelgroep om in te spelen op behoeften.

3️⃣ Mijn aanpak van strategie, SEO & CRO is pragmatisch en klantgericht. Ranken is een middel, geen doel. Het einddoel is om bezoekers de best mogelijke gebruikerservaring te bieden en ze te laten converteren. Daarom werk ik altijd vanuit een strategie.

4️⃣ Ik zet mijn specialisme SEO en CRO in om bedrijfsdoelstellingen te bereiken vanuit een strategie. Met een strategie die aansluit op de doelgroep en buyer journey, werk ik aan het aantrekken van de doelgroep (relevante bezoekers) en het optimaliseren van de klantreis, met als uiteindelijk doel het behalen (en optimaliseren) van conversie.

5️⃣ Beslissingen maak ik op basis van grondige analyse van zowel kwantitatieve als kwalitatieve data, altijd met het doel om waarde te creëren voor de organisatie en de (eind)klant.

6️⃣ Persoonlijke ontwikkeling is belangrijk voor mij. Ik ben altijd op zoek naar nieuwe kansen om mijn expertise uit te breiden en toe te passen. Hiervoor lees ik graag! 👨🏽‍💻📚

7️⃣ Om op de hoogte te blijven van de nieuwste trends en ontwikkelingen in online marketing, bezoek ik regelmatig een (online) event/webinar of speur ik content op Google en LinkedIn. Zo kan ik continu innoveren en mijzelf uitdagen in mijn werk.

Meer over mij buiten online marketing:

8️⃣ Tussen alle strategieën en optimalisaties door vind ik het belangrijk om fysiek in vorm te blijven. Ik besteed elke week tijd aan sporten. En ja, ik doe mijn best om gezond te eten... meestal.

9️⃣ Ik houd enorm veel van reizen (ontdekken van verschillende culturen, talen en gerechten), terrassen (wel zoveel mogelijk zon graag 😂) en kan ik zo nu en dan genieten van gamen, bordspellen of gewoon een toffe serie!

🔟 Ik deel regelmatig mijn inzichten op LinkedIn, omdat ik geloof dat we met het delen van inzichten elkaar kunnen helpen en versterken - ik leer er in elk geval heel veel van 😊

People & Culture | Talent management | Strategy & Change | Coaching,"My career in HR evolved out of a passion for people and a curiosity around what drives them. After more than fifteen years in the field of improving business results by maximising people’s potential, I still strongly believe that it is the people who make a company.

My drive for Performance Management as an HR responsibility and how this contributes to realise the business results reflects in my desire to work closely with the business. I always look at HR from a business perspective and believe that HR is there to facilitate. Being the bridge between HR and the business enables me to approach HR topics from different angles and therefore build/improve processes and procedures more effectively.

Having worked and lived in Asia, I have encountered a lot of cultural differences, different views on HR and business directions. I have set up HR departments from scratch in challenging, multicultural and global settings and have a proven ability to build, motivate and lead teams. In most of my roles I combined growing people as well as organizations through HR improvement projects, annual operational plans, coaching and by leading/driving the HR agenda.

What do I bring? 
♦ An excellent track record for building strong relationships with senior leaders and managers enabling
